<h2>Responsive Design Webpage (200 points)</h2>
<p><strong>Project Description:</strong><br>
  Using Adobe XD, you will design a one-page responsive design for the unconference BarCamp Harrisburg. Your designs should include two interactive piecesâ€”one for desktop (up to 1920px width) and one for mobile (320px width to represent portrait mode on mobile devices).</p>
<p>The finished HTML page should display responsively, include responsive image techniques, and include the SVG logo. You will use CSS3 media queries to target mobile devices, tablets, and desktop computers.<br>
  Development Requirements:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Your design should work responsively with no horizontal scrolling.</li>
  <li>The SVG version of the logo must be used.</li>
  <li>Your design should use at least one (1) non-system web font.</li>
  <li>Images should scale responsively.</li>
  <li>Your page should include a favicon and Apple touch icon.</li>
  <li>Your design should have a functional responsive navigation.</li>
  <li>Your finished project should be published on your website.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Process:</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Sketches/Wireframing.</strong> You will develop a desktop and mobile wireframe outlining all of the major elements in the page. Consider what the primary, secondary, and tertiary messages are on the site? Who is the audience?</li>
  <li><strong>Design.</strong> Upon wireframe approval, you will create designs based on your wireframes. You should be designing the desktop and mobile versions in parallel, and ensure that both present identical messages.</li>
  <li><strong>Design Critique.</strong> You will take part in an in-class design critique where you will provide constructive criticism to your classmates on their designs, as well as receive feedback on yours.</li>
  <li><strong>Revisions.</strong> You will revise the design, if necessary, to address improvements uncovered during the critique.</li>
  <li><strong>Development.</strong> You will proceed to develop the website in your local environment. Upon completion, the finished site should be published on your website.</li>
  <li><strong>Final Critique.</strong> You will participate in a final group critique where we review each of the sites.</li>
