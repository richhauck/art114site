<p>Where do you start when creating a website? You could obviously type out a new HTML page, or you could keep a template folder around that you copy each time you start a new project. That said, there are some tools out there that can help:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://html5boilerplate.com/">HTML5 Boilerplate</a> - an open source and great starting point for creating a website. While it is an opnionated approach, it includes nearly everything you need to get started.</li>
  <li><a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/starter-kit/">Google Web Starter Kit</a> (no longer supported)</li>
  <li>You can create a new HTML boilerplate page with your text editor using Emmet.
    <ol>
      <li>Create a new document in your text editor</li>
      <li>Save it with an .html extension</li>
      <li>In the file, type <strong>html:5 </strong>and then hit tab.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Items your starting project should include:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Every page should contain the following meta tag (to assist with responsive layouts):
		{%highlight html %}<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">{% endhighlight %}
	</li>
  <li>You should dedicate a folder for vendor, or third-party code. This should be a place that houses third-party code you have downloaded for use in your site, and it should remain untouched by you, as it will make updating easier.</li>
  <li>A <a href="www.robotstxt.org">robots.txt</a> file</li>
  <li>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Favicon">favicon</a></li>
  <li>An <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/AppleApplications/Reference/SafariWebContent/ConfiguringWebApplications/ConfiguringWebApplications.html">Apple Touch Icon</a></li>
  <li>An <a href="http://ogp.me/">Open Graph</a> image for popular services like Facebook (see: <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/sharing/webmasters">Facebook for Developers Guide</a>)</li>
</ul>
