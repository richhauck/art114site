<h3>Project Description:</h3>
<p>You will create a responsive website for the Fenetre Gallery, a (defunct) art gallery at HACC&rsquo;s midtown campus. The purpose of the site will be to promote exhibits, special events, programs, and communicate how to visit the gallery. </p>
<p>While you will be provided with a logo and some content, you are encouraged to create your own mock materials. For example, you could create an exhibit using another artist&rsquo;s work (provided you have their permission), your own artwork (provided it is not part of your graphic design portfolio), or of artwork found on Creative Commons (<a href="https://ccsearch.creativecommons.org)">https://ccsearch.creativecommons.org)</a>. You are welcome to modify or replace the logo, but you will be responsible for defining branding with a minimum of two fonts and five colors.<br>
  ain at least one image gallery with a slideshow and/or lightbox (the gallery could be for the current exhibit, permanent collection, etc.). This gallery will contain a minimum of six images of both vertical and horizontal orientation. This could be a page presenting the current exhibit, &ldquo;permanent collection,&rdquo; etc. The site should also utilize some sort of custom CSS or JavaScript animation.</p>
<p>For research, visit art gallery and museum websites and examine their site structure. See what messages are on the homepage. Recognize that every piece of art should be accompanied with a title and artist name.</p>
<h3>Development Requirements:</h3>
