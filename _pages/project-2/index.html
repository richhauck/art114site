<h2>Social Media Image Sharing Site (200 points)</h2>
<h3>Description:</h3>
<p>You are being tasked with creating the branding and design for a social media site that allows for the sharing, commenting, and uploading of images. Consider this as if it were a tool as a part of a sales pitch for building a website along the lines of Instagram.com, Flickr.com, Behance.net, Dribbble.com, etc. The name, branding, and specific nature of the site&rsquo;s theme are up to you. Will it be for sharing photography? Illustration? Design?</p>
<p>A site of this nature could potentially scale to thousands of pages with many users, so your responsibility will be to identify major page templates used by the site and create a site that someone can navigate through. At a minimum, you will probably need:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Homepage</li>
  <li>User Profile Page</li>
  <li>Upload Page</li>
  <li>Search/Browse Images</li>
  <li>Individual Image Page</li>
</ul>
<p>The design should include &ldquo;like&rdquo; buttons, tagging, commenting, and login/logout indications. You will also need to consider the naming conventions and organization of your CSS. Consider BEM or another naming convention. While the finished site should be visually polished, it needn&rsquo;t be fully functional. For instance, you could place an image upload or comment form, but the forms won&rsquo;t actually function. For the images themselves, you can use placeholder services such as <a href="http://pravatar.cc">http://pravatar.cc</a> or <a href="https://placeimg.com">https://placeimg.com</a>. For mock comments, lorem ipsum is fine. <br>
</p>
<h3>Development Requirements:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Â While not fully-functioning, the site should be easy to navigate, responsive, and published to your website.</li>
  <li>The Webpage must utilize a favicon.</li>
  <li>The site must contain a table (consider it for comments).</li>
  <li>The current page should be highlighted in the responsive navigation.</li>
  <li>Website should contain proper page titles for SEO.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Process:</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Sitemap.</strong> Draw up a sitemap outlining the structure of the website.</li>
  <li><strong>Wireframes. </strong>Develop a wireframe outlining all the major pages and interactions.</li>
  <li><strong>Branding.</strong> Choose a minimum of two fonts and five colors. The logo is up to you. Establish iconography. </li>
  <li><strong>Design Comps.</strong> Upon wireframe approval, create interactive designs in XD based on the wireframe. </li>
  <li><strong>Design Critique.</strong> You will take part in an in-class design critique where you will provide constructive criticism to your classmates on their designs, as well as receive feedback on yours.</li>
  <li><strong>Revisions.</strong> You will revise your design to address improvements uncovered during the critique stage.</li>
  <li><strong>Development.</strong> You will proceed to build the website. Upon completion, it will be uploaded to your website.</li>
  <li><strong>Final Critique.</strong> You will participate in a final group critique where we review each of the projects.</li>
</ul>
