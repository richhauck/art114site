</p>
<h3>Development Requirements:</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Your portfolio should have a favicon, meta descriptions, and well-named files and titles for SEO.</li>
  <li>Your portfolio items should contain captions providing the project title, the client and/or criteria of the assignment, and (possibly) how you successfully answered the design problem.</li>
  <li>An HTML version of your résumé should be present, as well as a way to download a PDF of your résumé.</li>
  <li>Secondary navigation should allow users to easily navigate from one section of your portfolio while they are in another.</li>

  <li>This project should reside at the domain name you purchased at the beginning of the semester. </li>
  <li>Your portfolio should be responsive.</li>
  <li>Consideration should be given towards refining projects completed in this class.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Process:</h3>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Content. </strong>You will assemble all of the content to be displayed in your site, including: </li>
  <ol>
    <li>A list of all projects with titles, descriptions, and mock clients and/or assignment requirements. </li>
    <li>Images associated with each project. Possibly written captions for each image. </li>
    <li>Your résumé. </li>
    <li>Copy for all of your pages. </li>
  </ol>
  <li><strong>Sitemap/Wireframing.</strong> You will develop a sitemap outlining the sections of your site, which will then be expanded further during a wireframe phase.</li>
  <li><strong>Design.</strong> Upon wireframe approval, you will create a design based on the wireframe. At this stage, you will choose the colors, images, fonts, and styles for the site. </li>
  <li><strong>Design Critique.</strong> You will take part in an in-class design critique where you will provide constructive criticism to your classmates on their designs, as well as receive feedback on yours.</li>
  <li><strong>Revisions.</strong> You will revise the design based on feedback and we will do a second class critique to see how concerns were addressed.</li>
  <li><strong>Development.</strong> You will proceed to develop the website on your local machine. Upon completion, it will be uploaded to your website.</li>
  <li><strong>Final Critique.</strong> You will participate in a final group critique where we review each of the portfolio sites.</li>
