</ol>
<p>All projects and assignments are due on the assigned deadline, at the beginning of class. For each class period an assignment is late its value will be dropped by one letter grade.</p>
<p>A (Superior work with consistent advancement) = 100 - 90 pt<br>
  B (above average which fulfills the requirements) = 89 - 80 pt<br>
  C (average work which fulfills minimum requirements) = 79 - 70 pt<br>
  D (below average passing grade, poor work) = 69 - 60 pt<br>
  F  (Unacceptable work, failure) = 59 - 0 pt</p>
<p>&quot;I&quot; (Upon recommendation of the student and with the approval of the instructor, the &quot;I&quot; (incomplete) grade may be applied. The &quot;I&quot; grade shows that coursework is incomplete and must be completed within eight weeks of the ensuing fall or spring semester. On the recommendation of the instructor and subject to the division administrator's approval, the eight-week period may be extended. An incomplete grade is computed as an F in the student's cumulative grade point average when not completed within the allotted period.</p>

<h2>Resubmission Policy</h2>
  One project may be resubmitted during the course of the semester. Projects eligible for resubmission must have been turned in on time and earned a grade of &quot;C&quot; or lower. Resubmission projects must be turned in, with instructor&rsquo;s consultation, within two weeks from the date the project was first graded and handed back to the students. This does not guarantee that the earned grade will be adjusted to a higher grade. Resubmission will not be accepted after Project 2.</p>

<h2>Attendance Policy:</h2>
<p>This is a participatory course. Therefore, attendance is required. In accordance with College Regulation 661, students are expected to attend all scheduled classes. Students will not be penalized for legitimate excused absences, and the instructor reserves the right to require supporting documentation or evidence (to be submitted on the first day of class following the absence); however, students are still responsible for all class work and assignments. Furthermore, because non-attendance precludes the opportunity for class participation, an instructor may lower a course grade after six or more hours (three class periods) of unexcused absences. More unexcused absences may result in being dropped from the class roster with a grade of &ldquo;F&rdquo; or &ldquo;W&rdquo; if, in the opinion of the instructor, there is no possibility of the student in completing the course successfully.</p>

<p>A student who decides to stop attending is responsible for completing the paperwork needed for an official withdrawal from a HACC course. Without the completed paperwork for a drop, a grade of &quot;F&quot; will be given to the student.</p>
<p>It is important that students arrive on time for class. Any time lost from class by showing up late or leaving without permission, from the instructor will be noted and added to the absence total. (A total of two late or early leave markings will count as one absence).</p>

<p>Attendance will be taken at the start of each class. If you arrive late, it is your responsibility to let me know that you are in class, otherwise you will be marked absent. </p>

<h2>Other Policies:</h2>
<p>Please respect your classmates and your instructor. If you have a cell phone, please switch it to silent mode or turn it off during class. A break will be provided during every class session. Computer stations are not to be used during lectures or presentations unless otherwise instructed.</p>
<p>All work done in class will be conducted in a professional manner. Questionable content and vulgarity will not be accepted in class or on any assignments or projects. Consult with me if you have any questions about the appropriateness of your creative concepts or social statements.</p>
<p>There may be special departmental events, such as visiting artist lectures, or field trips, that students will be strongly encouraged to attend. The dates and times for the events will be announced in class.</p>

<h2>Academic Dishonesty:</h2>
<p>Academic honesty is one of the fundamental principles upon which the College was founded and upon which it must operate to continue to perform its most important function. Students are expected to be honest in all of their academic endeavors. The College views academic dishonesty as a serious breach of conduct. Depending upon the nature and severity of the dishonest act, the faculty and the College may discipline a student for verifiable acts of dishonesty occurring in or out of the classroom. Specific procedures for handling incidents of academic dishonesty are contained in Administrative Procedure 594.</p>
<p>In the context of this class, this includes written, oral and visual work.</p>
